# C# Programming Repository

This repository contains a collection of C# examples and tutorials organized by topics, from basic concepts to advanced features. It serves as a learning resource and reference for C# programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several main directories:

- `01-Basics`: Fundamental C# concepts and syntax
- `02_Basics`: Intermediate concepts like arrays, methods, and exceptions
- `03_OOP`: Object-oriented programming concepts
- `04_AdvanceC#`: Advanced C# features and techniques

## Topics Covered

### 01-Basics

Basic C# concepts to get you started:

1. **Hello World** - Simple introduction to C# syntax
2. **Data Types** - Overview of basic data types in C#
3. **Basic Operations** - Arithmetic operations and operators
4. **User Input Calculator** - Working with user input and basic calculations

### 02_Basics

Intermediate C# programming concepts:

1. **Arrays** - Working with collections of data
2. **Methods** - Creating and using functions
3. **Params Keyword** - Variable number of arguments
4. **Exceptions** - Error handling with try-catch
5. **Ternary Operator** - Conditional expressions
6. **String Interpolation** - Modern string formatting
7. **Multi-Dimensional Arrays** - Working with matrix-like data structures

### 03_OOP

Object-Oriented Programming principles and implementation:

1. **Classes and Objects** - The foundation of OOP
2. **Constructors** - Object initialization
3. **Inheritance** - Code reuse and hierarchies
4. **Abstract Classes** - Creating template classes
5. **Static Members** - Class-level members
6. **Comprehensive Example** - Applying OOP concepts together
7. **Array of Objects** - Working with collections of objects
8. **Method Overriding** - Polymorphism in action

### 04_AdvanceC #

Advanced C# features for more complex programming:

1. **toString Method** - Object representation
2. **Polymorphism** - Objects taking multiple forms
3. **Interfaces** - Defining contracts for classes
4. **Lists** - Dynamic collections
5. **List of Objects** - Working with collections of custom types
6. **Getters and Setters** - Property access control
7. **Auto-Implemented Properties** - Simplified property syntax
8. **Enums** - Type-safe constants
9. **Generics** - Type-independent code
10. **Multi-Threading** - Concurrent programming

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Learning Path**: Follow the directories in order (01-Basics → 02_Basics → 03_OOP → 04_AdvanceC#) for a structured learning experience.
2. **Compilation**: Compile any example using the C# compiler: `csc filename.cs`
3. **Execution**: Run the compiled executable: `./filename` (on Linux/Mac) or `filename.exe` (on Windows)

## Key C# Concepts Explained

### Fundamental Concepts

- **Namespaces**: Organize code and avoid naming conflicts
- **Classes & Objects**: Core building blocks of OOP
- **Methods**: Functions that perform operations
- **Variables & Data Types**: Store and manipulate data

### Object-Oriented Programming

- **Encapsulation**: Hiding implementation details
- **Inheritance**: Creating specialized classes
- **Polymorphism**: Objects behaving differently based on context
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems

### Advanced Features

- **Exception Handling**: Gracefully manage errors
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts between classes
- **Generics**: Create reusable, type-safe code
- **LINQ**: Query collections efficiently
- **Multi-threading**: Execute code concurrently
